## Last Played on Apple Music

This repo allows you to display the last song you played on Apple Music and embed it as an image wherever you please.

It requires paid Apple Developer account. It also requires you to have an active subscription to Apple Music (although I'm not 100% sure about this one)

More about getting Developer and User tokens and just a bit more behind this: https://rosnovsky.us/blog/apple-music
